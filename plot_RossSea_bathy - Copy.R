# The intent is to be able to create maps for plotting various figures
# related to data collected in the Ross Sea in 2011-12 at part of the PRISM
# field program
#
# NOTE: I seem to have an issue with the map being displayed in the figure
# window. If that happens, just run the basemap command below on its own.
